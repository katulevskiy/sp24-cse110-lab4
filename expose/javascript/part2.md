1. 3 because prices has 3 elements
2. 150 because we calculated discounted price
3. 150 because it is the same discounted price of 150 rounded to 150
4. \[ 50, 100, 150 \] because it contains each price with discount and rounded
5. Error, i is out of scope. It is only valid inside for loop.
6. Error, discountedPrice is out of scope. It is only valid inside for loop.
7. 150, finalPrice is defined in function scope, so it works.
8. \[ 50, 100, 150 \] since scoping is correct, works as #4
9. We won't reach line 11, will panic before, because we will be try to push to const discounted (invalid array range).
10. We won't reach line 11, will panic before, because we will be try to push to const discounted (invalid array range).
11. We won't reach return statement, will panic before, because we will be try to push to const discounted (invalid array range).
12. A. student.name
    B. student\["Grad Year"\]
    C. student.greeting()
    D. student\["Favorite Teacher"\].name
    E. student.courseload\[0\]
13. A. 32 string concat
    B. 1 convert to int then sub
    C. 3 add 0
    D. 3null string concat
    E. 4 true is 1 then int add
    F. 0 false is 0 then int add null = 0
    G. 3undefined string concat
    H. NaN undefined convert to number is NaN
14. A. true convert to int
    B. false both strings
    C. true == converted types
    D. false === checked for same type
    E. false == converted true to 1, 1 not == 2
    F. true type is same, value is same
15. == compares values after converting them to a common type (type coercion), === compares both values and types, requiring them to be exactly the same.

17. \[ 2, 4, 6 \] modifyArray function iterates over each element of the array, applies the doSomething callback to each element (which doubles the number), and pushes the result to a new array. Thus, each number in the original array \[1, 2, 3\] is doubled.
18. Done in part2-question18.js
